## Tidal challenge code review task

You are given a code solution and we want you to perform a code review. We do not expect you to write your own code, just comment on the existing one.

The original task description is provided in [task.md](./task.md).

Treat this as a code review as if it was a real code review with a colleague you work with closely. We don't expect you to spend more than 2 hours on the review.

## Deliverables

Submit a code review on the pull request. The code example is real and we want you you give constructive feedback on the solution. Please use the github pull request commenting system. 

In addition, we would like to you give some remarks the following:
- How can the code be improved
- what are the limitations of the provided solution

PS: remember to click **submit review** when you are done. If not, comments are not visible for others.
